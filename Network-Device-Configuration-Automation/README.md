*Network Device Configuration Automation*

This project includes a Python script that uses the Netmiko library to automate the configuration of network devices.

*Getting Started*
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

*Prerequisites*
You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python here.

You also need to install the Netmiko library. You can install it using pip:

pip install netmiko

Usage
The script network_config.py connects to a network device, retrieves its current configuration, applies a new configuration, and logs all actions.

You need to provide the device parameters (IP address, username, and password) and the configuration commands you want to apply.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:

python network_config.py

This will run the script with the device parameters and configuration commands defined in the script.
